# MyReads Project

This app allows the user to search a library of books and add relevant titles to three lists.

- Currently Reading
- Want To Read
- Read

Further you can move the book titles between these shelves as you work your way through your reading list, and can always search for and add new things to read.
Your MyReads book list is stored online and can be accessed anywhere you go with an internet connection.

## TL;DR

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* your browser should load at localhost:3000
